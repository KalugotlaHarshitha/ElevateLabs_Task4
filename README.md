**# "The Tableau dashboard was created by constructing four distinct sheets for key insights, displaying Total Profit in currency format on a KPI card, creating bar charts for Profit by Region and Profit by Ship Mode, and displaying the Top Customers by Profit using a Top N filter. All of the sheets were organized in a dashboard with filters for consistency and interactivity."
